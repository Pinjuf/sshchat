# SSHChat
## A chatroom server that runs over SSH

> This code is still in it's earliest stages, and still lacks a lot.
  At this point, it's really nothing more than a sketch.

### Setting up
The code requires an RSA private key, named `rsa.private`.
> The name can be easyily changed in the config part of the code

### Running the server
To run, simply execute `main.py`.
